Welcome, this site is meant to host various information related to NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), the economics of the NBA, and/or the Atlanta Hawks. If you are looking for opinionated content, then you will be disappointed by this site. The goal is to provide explain issues within the NBA, disperse information, and provide insight that may not be available elsewhere. Hopefully, you will be a bit more knowledgeable from some aspect of this site.

This site does not necessarily replace anything I have written over at [Peachtree Hoops](http://www.sbnation.com/users/hawksfanatic) or imply I will not write over there. One reason for this site is because certain outputs that I create are not supported on an SBNation platform.

At this time, it is unclear as to what information will populate this site and how it will be structured. It is also unclear how often this site will have updates, but the [RSS feed](http://atlhawksfanatic.github.io/feed.xml) will update when a new post arises.

Enjoy.
