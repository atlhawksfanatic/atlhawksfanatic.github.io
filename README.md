# Purpose

If you're reading this, then you must know about http://atlhawksfanatic.github.io and probably know it's hosted on Github. This small site was built using [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). Feel free to browse around this repository to see how the site is built, but you'll likely be able to figure out things better and faster through looking at the original [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) repository from which this is built off of.
