This site's purpose is to provide various information related to the NBA's Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), its Last 2 Minute Reports (L2M), the economics of the NBA, and possibly the Atlanta Hawks. If you are looking for opinionated content or hot takes, then you will be disappointed by this site. My goal is to explain issues within the NBA, disperse information, and provide insight that may not be available elsewhere. Hopefully, you can gain a bit of knowledge from some aspect of this site.

For those curious about the "fanatic" portion of the atlhawksfanatic moniker: It comes from an old program I used to participate in during the early 2000s for Atlanta Hawks home games. The program was first called the [Fanatical Fans Section](https://web.archive.org/web/20030416131507/http://www.nba.com/hawks/fans/Hawks_Fanatical_Fan_Program_20-56831-33.html) but it eventually morphed into the [Hawk-a-Licious Fan Section](http://web.archive.org/web/20050407181111/http://www.nba.com:80/hawks/fans/Hawks_Fanatical_Fan_Program_20-56831-33.html) and then, poof....gone before the end of the 2004-05 NBA season and never spoken of by the organization again.

The organization created a similar program that they titled the [6th Man Section](http://www.nba.com/hawks/6th-man-section/) around 2011. But the *original* group was called the Fanatical Fans.

And that is where the the name comes from. It's not a reference from how intense of a fan of the organization I am/was but an homage to being a fan during quite possibly the worst time to be an Atlanta Hawks fan.
